While awaiting your reply I searched the web for references to the JPL
ephemerides. I found reference to a JPL service called Horizons
through which you can interactively request customized ascii
ephemerides. These are then sent to you via E-mail. The URL of the
service is:

  telnet://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov:6775

and documentation for it can be found at:

  ftp://naif-sun.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/ssd/Horizons_doc.ps

This looks quite adaquate for our needs, so we won't need any software
of our own to generate ephemerides.
