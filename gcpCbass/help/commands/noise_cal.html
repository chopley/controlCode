<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/SwitchState.html>SwitchState</a> state</b></code>
     <DD> The desired state of the noise source <code>on</code> or <code>off</code>.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example 1:
<DD> The following example turns the noise-cal signal on for 10
     seconds.

<pre>
 noise_cal on
 until $elapsed > 10s
 noise_cal off
</pre>

<DT> Context:
<DD> To calibrate the response of the BICEP correlator to a signal being
     presented to a given antenna of the BICEP, a stable noise source is
     injected into the receiver signal path and compared to the signal
     received from an astronomical calibration source. During normal
     observing, signals coming from random sources on the sky can then
     be compared against the noise source to ascertain their
     flux.  This requires that one be able to switch the noise source
     into the signal path periodically. The noise source actually
     remains switched on all of the time, but it is usually
     disconnected from the receiver inputs by switches. There is one
     master switch on the output of the noise generator followed by
     13 individual switches that connect the noise source to each
     receiver. So with all of these switches open, there are two
     switches between each receiver and the noise source. This 
     ensures sufficient isolation between the noise source and the
     receivers. The <code>noise_cal</code> command switches all of these
     switches either on or off. To switch them individually, use the
     <code><a href=setreg.html>setreg</a></code> command to write
     directly to the <code>noise_dio.output</code> register. The first
     13 bits, spread between the first 2 bytes of this register,
     control the individual switches. The 14th bit controls the master
     switch.
