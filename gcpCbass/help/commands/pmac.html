<H1>PMAC Notes.</H1>

There is a simple terminal emulator program for configuring the PMAC
motion controller and downloading code into it.
<p>
To start it up type "pmacterm".
<p>
Serial communication is currently set to 38400 baud. This is outside
the spec of the fiber optic modems so it may be necessary to
reduce it in the future.
At this speed code download takes about 6 seconds.
Remember that the last line of the program should be a save.
<p>
To completely reset the PMAC type "$$$***". This will break the
VME bus DPRAM comms so you must "dl" the code, save and do a "$$$"
reset. Then do a "unflag pmac" command in the viewer command window.
