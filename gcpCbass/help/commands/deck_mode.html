<font color=blue><a name=deck_mode> <code><b>deck_mode</b></code> </a></font>
<P>
Tell the tracker how to position the deck axis when tracking a source.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/DeckMode.html>DeckMode</a> mode</b></code>
     <DD> The deck-axis tracking mode.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example 1:
<DD> The following example tells the tracker task that while tracking
     sources it should fix the deck axis angle at 45 degrees.

<pre>
  deck_mode zero
  offset dk, 45.0
</pre>

<DT> Example 2:
<DD> The next example tells the tracker task that while tracking
     sources it should maintain the deck axis angle at 45 degrees plus
     the parallactic angle of the source.

<pre>
  deck_mode track
  offset dk, 45.0
</pre>

<DT> Track mode:
<DD> By default the position of the deck drive is continually adjusted
     while tracking a source such that the source appears to stay at
     a fixed rotation angle about the center of the field. The actual
     orientation angle is set by the deck-angle tracking offset that
     was last set with the <code><a href=offset.html>offset</a></code>
     command. This is refered to above as &quot;<code>track</code>&quot;
     mode.
<P>
<DT> Zero mode:
<DD> An alternative tracking mode involves holding the deck at a
     fixed angle. In this mode, as one tracks a source across the sky,
     it will appear to rotate about the center of the field. This mode
     is primarily designed for use during pointing calibration. The
     fixed deck angle is set by the current deck-angle tracking
     offset, as set with the <code><a href=offset.html>offset</a></code>
     command. This is refered to as &quot;<code>zero</code>&quot;
     because it involves tracking zero deck angle plus an optional
     tracking offset.
