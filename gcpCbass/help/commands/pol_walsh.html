<P>
Set one or more receivers to a particular step in their polarization walsh sequences.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Receivers.html>Receivers</a> ant</b></code>
     <DD> The set of receivers whose polarization states are to be modified.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/PhaseStep.html>PhaseStep</a> step</b></code>
     <DD> The step size, from:
          <UL>
          <LI> <code><b>full</b></code> - Full steps of the stepper motor.
          <LI> <code><b>half</b></code> - Half steps of the stepper motor.
          </UL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/WalshStep.html>WalshStep</a> wstep</b></code> 
     <DD> The walsh function step (0-15).  
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example sets the polarization states of receivers rx0 and rx9 to the configuration given by the first step of their walsh sequences:
<pre>
 pol_walsh rx0+rx9, half, 0
</pre>

<P>
<DT> Context: <DD> When observing with polarized receivers, we require
observations at LL, RR, LR and RL to recover the full set of Stokes
parameters.  This is accomplished efficiently by stepping the
polarization state of each receiver according to one of sixteen
orthogonal Walsh functions (1 corresponding to left circular, and -1
to right circular polarization).  Since Walsh functions integrate to 0
(except for the lowest order one), over a complete period of the
Walsh functions, each receiver will spend equal time in either
polarization state.  Since the product of two Walsh functions is
another Walsh function, each baseline will furthermore spend equal
times in the parallel (LL and RR) and crossed (LR and RL) polarization
states, and, as it turns out, equal time in each of the LL, RR, LR and
RL states.
<p>
This function lets you explicitly set the polarization states of a set
of receivers to one step in the Walsh sequence.
<p>
The Walsh functions used are the same ones used in the slow walshing
(see <font color=blue><a href=slow_walsh.html>slow_walsh</a></font>),
and are of period 16, generated from the Hadamard matrices (as
described, for example, in TMS 7.5).  I use the highest-order 13 of
these.
