<P>
Read a reply string from a device on the GPIB bus and display it.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><a href=Gpib../dataTypes/Dev.html>GpibDev</a> device</code>
     <DD> The address of the GPIB device to read a reply from.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The BICEP power meter has GPIB address 13. When left in its default
     free-running mode it sends readings to anyone who will
     listen. The following example reads one of these power readinds
     and displays it.
     
<pre>
  gpib_read 13
</pre>

<DT> Context:
<DD> One of the boards that the antenna control control system manages is a
     VME interface to a GPIB bus. In the current design of the BICEP
     this will be used solely to interact with a power meter, but
     in principle up to 30 instruments can be daisy-chained on a
     GPIB bus, so this command provides a simple way to query any
     instrument on the bus. If you specify a GPIB address that doesn't
     correspond to any instrument on the bus, or if the targeted
     device doesn't have anything to send then this call will time-out
     after 5 seconds.
