<P>
Calibrate the tilts of the telescope axes.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Tilt.html>Tilt</a> ha</b></code>
     <DD> The tilt of the azimuth axis along the direction of
          increasing hour angle (degrees).
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Tilt.html>Tilt</a> lat</b></code>
     <DD> The tilt of the azimuth axis along the direction of
          increasing latitude (degrees).
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Tilt.html>Tilt</a> el</b></code>
     <DD> The tilt of the elevation axis perpendicular to the azimuth
          ring, measured clockwise around the direction of the azimuth
	  vector (degrees).
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Examples:
<DD> The following example says that the azimuth axis is tilted 3.5
     degrees east, and 23 arcminutes north. It also says that the
     elevation axis is tilted out of the plane of the azimuth by
     -0.3 degrees.

<pre>
  tilts 3.5, 0:23, -0.3
</pre>

<DT> Context:
<DD> The BICEP Telescope axes can not be aligned to the sub-arcsecond
     precision required by the BICEP. The misalignment of each axis from
     the ideal is represented as a tilt. Before the control system can
     accurately track a source, you must call the tilts command to
     tell it what these tilts are.
