<font color=blue><a name=exit> <code><b>exit [reason]</b></code> </a></font>
<P>
Terminate execution of the containing script.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Optional Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><a href=../dataTypes/String.html>String</a> reason</code>
     <DD> If the user previously used the <a
          href=cleanup.html>cleanup</a> command to register a block of
          statements to be run when the script terminated, this
          optional value is assigned to the <code>reason</code>
          argument of this block. If no value is provided, the string,
          &quot;exit&quot; is substituted.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example terminates execution of the script after
     running any cleanup statements that the user registered. The
     <code>reason</code> argument of the block of cleanup statements
     is passed the value &quot;exit&quot;.
     
<pre>
 exit
</pre>

<DT> Example of passing a reason to a block of cleanup statements.
<DD> The following example registers a print statement to be called on
     exit, then sometime later executes the
     &quot;<code>exit</code>&quot; command, saying that it is doing so
     because of a timeout. As a result the single cleanup statement
     prints out &quot;Reason for exiting: timeout&quot;.

<pre>
 cleanup {
   print &quot;Reason for exiting: &quot;, $reason,
 }
 ...
 exit &quot;timeout&quot;
</pre>

<DT> Context:
<DD> This command is used to abort a script without executing any of
     the commands that follow it. There is an implicit exit statement
     at the end of every script, or when a script is aborted
     externally. If any cleanup statements have been registered with
     the <a href=cleanup.html>cleanup</a> command, they are executed
     before the script terminates.
<P>
     Note that if an exit statement is executed from within a block of
     cleanup statements, this terminates the script immediately
     without either completing the remaining statements, or executing
     the list of cleanup statements again.
