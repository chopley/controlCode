<P>
Switch the IF amplifiers of selected correlator channels on or off.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Receivers.html>Receivers</a> receivers</b></code>
     <DD> The set of receivers to target.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Bands.html>Bands</a> bands</b></code>
     <DD> The set of frequency bands to target.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/SwitchState.html>SwitchState</a> state</b></code>
     <DD> The desired state of the selected channels: <code>on</code> or <code>off</code>.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example 1:
<DD> The following example turns off the IF amplifiers that connect
     signals from all receivers except rx1 and rx2 to the correlator
     of band3.
<pre>
 channel all-rx1-rx2, band3, off
</pre>

<DT> Example 2:
<DD> The next example turns off all of the IF amplifers that
     connect receiver 4 to each correlator.
<pre>
 channel rx4, all, off
</pre>

<P>
<DT> Context:
<DD> The BICEP has 13 receivers (rx0..rx12) whose 10GHz bandpasses are
     split into 10 bands (band0..band9) by a channelizer. The
     resulting 130 signal paths are refered to as channels. Each of
     these channels contains an IF amplifier to boost the received
     signals before feeding them into one correlator module per band.
     The channelizer provides switches to enable or disable these IF
     amplifiers. Disabling an IF amplifier effectively disconnects the
     the input signal from its target correlator input and thus can be
     used to measure correlator offsets.
<P>
     Note that all of the IFs are switched on when the system starts.
