<font color=blue><a name=while> <code><b>while</b>(clause) {commands}</code></a></font>
<P>
Repeatedly run a set of commands while a given boolean clause is true. 
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code>clause</code>
     <DD>The <a href=../dataTypes/Boolean.html>Boolean</a> expression that is
         evaluated just before each new iteration of the loop. If it
	 evaluates to true, then the commands of the while loop are
	 executed again. If it evaluates to false, execution of the
	 loop is terminated.
     <DT><code>commands</code>
     <DD>The block of commands that the loop executes.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example uses a while loop to alternate between
     observing a calibrator source and a target source, during the
     time window of 3:30 to 4:15 local sidereal time. The preceding
     <a href=until.html>until</a> command is there because
     otherwise if the while loop was encountered before 3:30 LST, its
     clause would be false so it would be skipped.

<pre>
 until $after(3:30, LST)
 while($between(3:30, 4:15, LST)) {
   track 3c286
   until $elapsed &gt;= 1m
   track 3c345
   until $elapsed &gt;= 10m
 }
</pre>

<DT> Context:
<DD> While loops are used to repeatedly execute a sequence of commands,
     while a given condition is true. The loop can be exited before
     the condition becomes false by using the
     <code><a href=break.html>break</a></code> command. Similarly,
     the next iteration of the loop can be started before
     the current iteration has been completed via the
     <code><a href=next.html>next</a></code> command.
