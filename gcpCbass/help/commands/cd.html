<font color=blue><code><b>cd</b> pathname</code></font>
<P>
Change the current working directory.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Dir.html>Dir</a> pathname</b></code>
     <DD> The full name of the directory that is to be used as
          the new working directory.
     </DL>
<P>

<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example changes the current working directory to
     a directory that contains scheduling scripts, then uses the
     scheduling script to queue one of these scripts. Without the
     preceding cd command, the user would have to type in the full
     path name of the observe.sch script.

<pre>
  cd ~bicepdaq/BICEP/sch
  schedule observe.sch
</pre>

<P>
<DT> Context:
<DD> The <code>cd</code> and <a href=pwd.html><code>pwd</code></a>
     commands act essentially like the unix shell commands of the same
     name.
<P>
     When the user doesn't specify a full pathname to a command like
     <a href=schedule.html><code>schedule</a></code>, the full pathname is
     constructed by appending the user's relative pathname to the
     current working directory. The <code>cd</code> command allows
     this working directory to be changed, while the
     <a href=pwd.html><code>pwd</code></a> command lets
     one see what it is currently set to.

<P>
<DT> Warning:
     In scripts, pathnames to commands like <a
     href=schedule.html><code>schedule</a></code> are converted to full
     pathnames when the script is compiled, not when they are run, so
     <code>cd</code> commands are essentially useless in scripts,
     because they are executed long after all filenames have been set
     in stone. In fact the only good reason that I can think of for
     using a <code>cd</code> command in a script is in the the control program
     initialization file, where it can be used to set the working
     directory of interactive users.
<P>
     The reason for expanding filenames during compilation is to allow
     the compiler to check that the corresponding files and
     directories exist before accepting scripts for execution.
