<P>
Return true if the current time is within a given window of time.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><a href=../dataTypes/Time.html>Time</a> start</code>
     <DD> The start time of the window (hours).
     <DT><code><a href=../dataTypes/Time.html>Time</a> end</code>
     <DD> The end time of the window (hours).
     <DT><code><a href=../dataTypes/TimeScale.html>TimeScale</a> scale</code>
     <DD> The timescale of $start and $end, from:
         <UL>
	 <LI> utc - Universal Coordinated Time.
         <LI> lst - Local Sidereal Time.
         </UL>
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example 1:
<DD> The following example tests whether the local sidereal time is between
     03:45 and 04:45. If not, it waits until 03:45 is reached, then
     procedes to observe 3C345 until 04:45 LST.

<pre>
 until $between(03:45, 04:45, LST)
 track 3c345
 until $after(04:45, LST)
</pre>


<DT> Example 2:
<DD> The following example tests whether the time of day (UTC) is between 03:45
     and 04:45. If not, it waits until 03:45 is reached, then stows
     the telescope until 04:45.

<pre>
 until $between(03:45, 04:45, UTC)
 track stow
 until $after(04:45, UTC)
</pre>

<P>
<DT> Context:
<DD> This function is designed for the situation where one wants to
     allocate a specific window in LST or UTC to observing a given
     source. Note that if the end time is numerically less than the
     start time, then the end time is interpretted as being an LST on
     the next day. Thus if one swapped the times in the above example:

<pre>
 until $between(04:45, 03:45, LST)
</pre>

     then this would actually return true for times between 04:45 and 23:59
     as well as from 00:00 to 03:45. This is precisely the opposite
     of the original example.
