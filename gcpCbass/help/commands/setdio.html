<P>
Change the value of the output register of a given digital I/O board.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><a href=Dio../dataTypes/Board.html>DioBoard</a> reg</code>
     <DD> The name of the digital I/O board.
     <DT><code><a href=../dataTypes/BitMaskOper.html>BitMaskOper</a> operator</code>
     <DD> The way to combine the template value with the current value
          of the output register.
     <DT><code><a href=../dataTypes/BitMask.html>BitMask</a> mask</code>
     <DD> The template bit-mask to be combined with the current value
          of the output register.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example 1:
<DD> The following example sets the states of outputs 0 and 3 of the
     noise generator digital I/O board to high resistance, without
     changing the states of the other outputs.
 
<pre>
  setdio ngen, set, b0 + b3
</pre>

<DT> Example 2:
<DD> The following example clears the states of outputs 0 and 3 of the
     noise generator digital I/O board to low resistance, without
     changing the states of the other outputs.
 
<pre>
  setdio ngen, clear, b0 + b3
</pre>

<DT> Example 3:
<DD> All of the following examples set all outputs of the noise
     generator output to states corresponding to the bits of a 32 bit
     integer. Bits that are set to 1 correspond to high resistance
     outputs. Bits that are set to 0 correspond to low resistance
     outputs. In the first case the high resistance bits are specified
     as a set of bit names. In the second case they are specified as a
     binary number, in the third as a hexadecimal number, and in the
     final case, as a decimal number.
 
<pre>
  setdio ngen, assign, b0 + b3 + b5
  setdio ngen, assign, 0b101001
  setdio ngen, assign, 0x29
  setdio ngen, assign, 41
</pre>

<DT> Context:
<DD> The outputs of the National Instruments digital I/O boards that
     are being used by the BICEP are error-prone to set via the setreg
     command. The 32 opto-isolator outputs are mapped in a big-endian
     fashion to the 4 bytes of the output register, such that bit 0
     corresponds to bit 0 of output[3] and bit 8 corresponds to
     bit 0 of output[2]. This would be sufficiently confusing on its
     own if one didn't also have to contend with the fact that to
     set a given output to logical high (high resistance), one has to
     set the corresponding bit to low. The setdio command is an
     attempt to provide a more convenient way to set the outputs.
