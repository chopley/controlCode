<P>
Switch off or set the temperatures of one or more receiver heaters.

<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Receivers.html>Receivers</a> ant</b></code>
     <DD> The set of receivers whose heaters are to be controlled.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Heaters.html>Heaters</a> heaters</b></code>
     <DD> The heaters to be controlled. This is a set of one or more of:
         <UL>
         <LI> cryo     -  The heater in the cryogenic part of the receiver.
         <LI> ambient0 -  The first of two ambient temperature heaters.
         <LI> ambient1 -  The second of two ambient temperature heaters.
         <LI> all      -  All of the above heaters.
         </UL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/HeaterVoltage.html>HeaterVoltage</a> volts</b></code>
     <DD> The voltage of the heater between 0 and 10, or the word: off.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example turns off both ambient heaters in receivers 3
     and 4.
<pre>
 heater rx3+rx4, ambient0+ambient1, off
</pre>

<DT> Example 2:
<DD> The following example sets the target sensor voltages of the two
     ambient temperature controllers to 3.1v.
<pre>
 heater rx3, ambient0+ambient1, 3.1
</pre>

<P>
<DT> Context:
<DD> On power-up the heaters in each receiver are switched off. If they
     are needed, then they must be turned on and given a target
     temperature using this command. At the time of writing, none of
     these heaters are actually used.
