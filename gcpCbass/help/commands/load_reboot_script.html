Load a script to be run whenever the antenna control cpu reboots.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><a href=../dataTypes/Script.html>Script</a> filename(arguments)</code>
     <DD> The pathname (and optionally the arguments) of a readable
          file that contains the initialization script.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example tells the control program to try to
     read the file $BICEP_DIR/conf/bicepAntennaControl.init, compile it and arrange
     for the result to be executed whenever the antenna control cpu
     reboots. It replaces any existing reboot script. Note that
     in this example the script takes no arguments. If arguments
     are needed, see the documentation of the
     <a href=schedule.html>schedule</a> command.

<pre>
 load_reboot_script "$BICEP_DIR/conf/bicepAntennaControl.init"
</pre>

     Note that the quotes are needed in the above example to prevent
     the $ symbol being interpretted as a script operator.

<DT> Context:
<DD> Whenever the antenna control cpu is rebooted, the hardware that it
     controls is placed in a safe but useless default state. The
     antenna control system needs to be told many things about its
     environment before it can do anything useful. This is the role
     of the initialization script that the load_reboot_script loads.
     This script is simply a schedule that is automatically called
     upon to configure the antenna control system after each reboot, so it
     can contain any of the usual scheduling commands. It is
     recommended that the last thing that this file should do is turn
     on archiving, using the <code>inhibit false</code> command.
