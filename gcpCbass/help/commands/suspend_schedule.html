<font color=blue><code><b>suspend_schedule</b></code></font>
<P>
Temporarily suspend execution of the schedule that is currently running.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> (none)
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example pauses then resumes execution of the
     currently running scheduling script. Note that at least the
     second line would have to be typed from the command line, since
     there is no script running after the suspend_schedule command
     has been executed.

<pre>
  suspend_schedule
  ...
  resume_schedule
</pre>

<DT> Context:
<DD> This command is used to temporarily pause execution of the
     currently running schedule. The scheduler then waits until the
     user uses the <code><a
     href=resume_schedule.html>resume_schedule</a></code> command, before
     executing any more commands from the current schedule.
  
<P>
     If no schedule is currently running, this command has no effect.
