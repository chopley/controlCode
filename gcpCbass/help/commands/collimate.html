<P>
Calibrate the collimation of the radio or optical pointing axes.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Model.html>Model</a> model</b></code>
     <DD> The pointing axis to collimate.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Tilt.html>Tilt</a> size</b></code>
     <DD> The size of the tilt of the pointing axis.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/DeckAngle.html>DeckAngle</a> direction</b></code>
     <DD> The deck angle at which the collimation tilt is directed
          radially outwards.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Examples:
<DD> The following example says that the radio axis is tilted 0.5
     degrees outwards from the deck axis, along a deck angle of 23.32
     degrees.

<pre>
  collimate radio, 0.5, 23.32
</pre>

<DT> Context:
<DD> The axis along which the BICEP sensors are most sensitive, will not
     exactly lie along the deck rotation axis. The collimation command
     tells the control system what the misalignment is, so that it can
     counteract it with changes to the azimuth and elevation. The
     optical telescope and the radio receivers will have different
     collimation parameters, whereas the rest of their pointing models
     should be the same, so this command requires that you specify
     which pointing axis you are refering to.
<P>
     Before the control system can point the telescope accurately at a
     source, the collimate command should be called once for each
     axis, to set the collimation parameters.
