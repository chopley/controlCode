<font color=blue><code><b>resume_schedule</b></code></font>
<P>
Resume execution of a paused scheduling script.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> (none)
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example pauses then resumes execution of the
     currently running scheduling script. Note that at least the
     second line would have to be typed from the command line, since
     there is no script running after the resume_schedule command
     has been executed.

<pre>
  suspend_schedule
  ...
  resume_schedule
</pre>

<DT> Context:
<DD> After the current schedule has been paused by the
     <code><a href=suspend_schedule.html>suspend_schedule</a></code>
     command, this command can be used to resume execution. The
     script continues executing from where it was stopped.
