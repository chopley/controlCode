<font color=blue><a name=until> <code><b>until</b> clause</code> </a></font>
<P>
Halt script execution until the given boolean clause becomes true.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code>clause</code>
     <DD>The <a href=../dataTypes/Boolean.html>Boolean</a> condition that must
         be satisfied before the script is allowed to continue.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example pauses script execution for 5 minutes. The
     inclusion of the
     <code><a href=signaled.html>signaled</a></code>
     function allows the wait to be interrupted by an interactive user
     who types the user sends a quit <a href=signal.html>signal</a>.
<pre>
 until $elapsed() &gt; 5m | $signaled(quit)
</pre>
<DT> Context:
<DD> The <code>until</code> command provides the primary mechanism by
     which the timing of control system activities is scheduled. The
     condition that you provide is re-evaluated every 100ms until it
     becomes satisfied. At that point the next command in the script
     is executed.
