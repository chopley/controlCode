<P>
Temporarily disable or re-enable all of the IF amplifiers.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/SwitchState.html>SwitchState</a> state</b></code>
     <DD> The desired state of the IF amplifiers: <code>on</code> or <code>off</code>.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example 1:
<DD> The following example turns off all of the IF amplifiers.
<pre>
 channelizer off
</pre>

<DT> Example 2:
<DD> The next example re-enables those IF amplifiers that were switched
     on before the above command was executed.
<pre>
 channelizer on
</pre>

<P>
<DT> Context:
<DD> The BICEP has 13 receivers (rx0..rx12) whose 10GHz bandpasses are
     split into 10 bands (band0..band9) by a channelizer. The
     resulting 130 signal paths are refered to as channels. Each of
     these channels contains an IF amplifier to boost the received
     signals before feeding them into one correlator module per band.
     The channelizer provides switches to enable or disable these IF
     amplifiers. Disabling an IF amplifier effectively disconnects the
     the input signal from its target correlator input and thus can be
     used to measure correlator offsets. To switch individual channels
     on or off, use the alternative <code>channel</code> command. To
     temporarily disable the channelizer by turning off all IF
     amplifiers, without loosing the record of which individual
     channels were turned on, use the <code>channelizer</code>
     command. When the same command is used to re-enable the
     channelizer, only those channels that were previously
     individually turned on are switched on. The remainder remain
     switched off.
<P>
     Note that the channelizer is enabled when the system starts.
