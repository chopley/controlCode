<P>
Adjust the tracking offsets to move the image on the TV monitor.

<DL>
<DT> Mandatory Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/PointingOffset.html>PointingOffset</a>
         right</b></code>
     <DD> The distance to move the image right on the screen,
          expressed as an offset measured in degrees on the sky.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/PointingOffset.html>PointingOffset</a>
         up</b></code>
     <DD> The distance to move the image up on the screen,
          expressed as an offset measured in degrees on the sky.
     </DL>
<p>
<DT> Optional Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Antennas.html>Antennas</a> ant</b></code>
     <DD> A set of one or more antennas to which the command should be applied.
     <DD> Default is controlled by the <code><a href=setDefault../dataTypes/Antennas.html>setDefaultAntennas</a> command.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> Both of the the following examples would move a star image on the
     TV display of the optical telescope right by 3 arcseconds and down
     by 2 arcseconds.
<P>
     Using sexagesimal notation:

<pre>
  tv_offset 0:0:36, -0:0:18
</pre>

     or using decimal degrees notation:

<pre>
  tv_offset 0.01, -0.005
</pre>

<DT>Context:
<DD>To measure the free parameters of the telescope pointing model, a
    small optical telescope, attached rigidly to the deck-platform of
    the telescope, is used to see how well the telescope tracks
    stars. The discrepancies are then used to estimate improved
    pointing parameters.
<P>
    During optical pointing sessions the view through the optical
    telescope is displayed on a TV monitor. A pointing session
    involves visiting a large number of bright stars, one at a time,
    and for each star the adjusting the azimuth and elevation tracking
    offsets until the star is centered on a pair of cross-hairs. The
    observer then hits a button to tag the next record in the
    data-archive. At the end of the pointing session a separate
    program is then used to search out these tagged records, extract
    the recorded azimuth and elevation tracking offsets, and fit an
    improved pointing model to them.
<P>
    To move a star image on the screen of the TV monitor, one could in
    principle use the <a href="offset.html">offset</a> command to
    directly adjust the azimuth and elevation tracking offsets. This
    however is difficult, because the orientation of the display
    relative to the directions of increasing elevation and azimuth,
    changes as the deck rotates. Furthermore the required azimuth
    offset that is needed to move the star by a given amount on the TV
    display, varies with the elevation of the star being looked
    at. For these reasons the <code>tv_offset</code> command was
    written. It takes on the job of converting from offsets on the
    sky, as seen on the tv display, to azimuth and elevation offsets,
    taking into account the elevation of the source, and the rotation
    angle of the camera.
<P>
    Note that In order for the <code>tv_offset</code> to work
    correctly, it needs to know the fixed orientation angle of the
    optical telescope relative to the deck platform. This should be
    configured in the startup schedule using the <a
    href=tv_angle.html>tv_angle</a> command.
