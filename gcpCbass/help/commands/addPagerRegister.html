<h2>The <span class=command>addPagerRegister</span> command (usage)</h2>
<hr>


<h2><i>Context:</i></h2><p>

The addPagerRegister command adds a register condition that will cause the telescope operator to be paged (by email, pager or phone).
The condtion consists of a minimum and maximum value, and optional number of frames, delta flag and outOfRange flag.

<p>

By default, a page is sent if the value of the register is greater than or equal to min and less than or equal to 
max at any time.

<p>

If nFrame is set to greater than one, then the register condition must be met for nFrame consecutive seconds
for a page to be sent. 

<p>

If outOfRange is true, then a page is sent if the register value is less than min or greater than max.

<p>

If delta is true, then the value compared with minimum and maximum is the difference between the current and previous
values of the register, rather than its current value.

<p>

If register is the name of an array of register values, then the same condition is set for every element of the array, as if the
addPagerRegister had command had been given for each array element separately.

<h2><i>Examples:</i></h2><p>

<pre>
addPagerRegister array.fridge.Temperature[5],0,15,nFrame=5  # Page if fridge temperature 5 is between 0 and 15 degrees for 5 seconds
addPagerRegister array.weather.power[0],0,0,nFrame=2        # Page if receiver cabin power monitor bits are non-zero for two seconds
</pre>
