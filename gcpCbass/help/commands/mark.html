<P>
Change the set of feature markers to be recorded in the archive.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=FeatureChange.html>FeatureChange</a> change</b></code>
     <DD> What to do with the specified set of feature markers, from:
       <UL>
       <LI> <code><b>one</b></code> - Add them to the set of markers
                                      that are to be recorded in the
				      next frame.
       <LI> <code><b>add</b></code> - Add them to the set of markers
                                      that are to be recorded in
				      subsequent frames.
       <LI> <code><b>remove</b></code> - Remove them from the set of
                                      persistent markers previously
				      added with the <code>add</code>
				      argument.
       </UL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Features.html>Features</a> features</b></code>
     <DD> The set of features to use arcording to the above argument.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example sets feature bits 0 and 10 of the features
     register for one archived frame period.

<pre>
  mark one, f0+f10
</pre>

<DT> Example 2:
<DD> The following example sets feature bit 2 in the archive and
     leaves it set for five minutes before unsetting it.

<pre>
  mark add, f2
  until $elapsed > 5m
  mark remove, f2
</pre>

<DT> Example 3:
<DD> To remove all marks type:

<pre>
  mark remove, all
</pre>

<DT>Context:
<DD> The <code>mark</code> command provides a way to highlight one or
     more archive frames as special in the archive. There are two
     ways to do this.

<OL>
<LI> One can ask for a single frame to be marked as special. This is
     used during optical pointing to mark the time when the user
     thinks that the pointing star is centered under the cross-hairs.
<LI> One can mark all frames over an extended period by telling the
     system when to start including a given marker and later when to
     stop including it. This is to mark calibration observations.
</OL>
<P>  In both cases the specified features are guaranteed to appear in
     at least one frame, even if a persistent marker is added and then
     removed before the next frame is assembled for recording.
