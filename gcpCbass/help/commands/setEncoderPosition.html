<font color=blue><code><b>setEncoderPosition</b> rx, position</code></font>
<P>
Set the caltert index mark corresponding to a given receiver.
<P>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/RxBand.html>RxBand</a> rx</b></code>
     <DD> The receiver to which this position applies.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/TertPos.html>TertPos</a> position</b></code>
     <DD> The encoder position to associate with this receiver.
     </DL>
<DL>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example sets the encoder positions for the 30 GHz receiver to 19500:
<pre>
setEncoderPosition rx30ghz, 19500
</pre>

<DT> Context:

<DD> The Caltert (calibration/tertiary) CAN module maintains a trio of
encoder positions in XAC memory.  These positions are meant to be read
from 1-wire devices on the modules, but in practice this has proven to
be flaky at best.  Quite often the 1-wires are not found on startup,
and as a result the encoder positions are not read.
<p>
Without valid encoder positions for the receiver positions, the module
will obviously not respond to requests to move to predefined
positions, nor will it allow the calibrator load to be moved.
<p>
This command allows the user to explictly tell the caltert module
which encoder position to associate with a receiver.
