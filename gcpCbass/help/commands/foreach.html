<P>
Loop through a block of commands once for each member of a list.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code>type name</code>
     <DD> The datatype and name to give the loop variable. The
          datatype must match that of members of the following list.
     <DT><code>list</code>
     <DD> The list to iterate through. The loop variable will be set
          to the value of the next member of this list on each
	  iteration of the loop.
     <DT><code>commands</code>
     <DD> The list of commands to be executed by the loop.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example prints the contents of a list of strings,
     as a single line of words separated by spaces.
<pre>
 foreach(String s) {&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;} {
   print $s, &quot; &quot;
 }
 print &quot;\n&quot;
</pre>

     Note that the following script does the same thing.

<pre>
 listof String sl = {&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;}
 foreach(String s) $sl {
   print $s, &quot; &quot;
 }
 print &quot;\n&quot;
</pre>
<DT> Context:
<DD> The <code>foreach</code> command repeats a sequence of
     commands for different values of given parameter. For example,
     when scheduling a telescope, the list that you give the foreach
     command could be a list of sources that you want to observe. On
     the first iteration of the loop, the loop variable is set to the
     first member of the specified list. On the second iteration, it
     is set to the second member of the list, and so on until the end
     of the list is reached. The foreach statement then
     terminates. You can leave the loop before the last element of the
     list has been reached by using the <code><a
     href=break.html>break</a></code> command. Similarly,
     the next iteration of the loop can be started before
     the current iteration has been completed via the
     <code><a href=next.html>next</a></code> command.
