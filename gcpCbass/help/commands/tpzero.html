<P>
Tell the channelizer to measure new total-power zero-offsets.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Receivers.html>Receivers</a> receivers</b></code>
     <DD> The set of receivers to target.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Bands.html>Bands</a> bands</b></code>
     <DD> The set of frequency bands to target.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example 1:
<DD> The following example asks the channelizer task to find the
     total-power offsets of all correlator channels. This process
     takes a couple of integrations to complete, so in
     the example, the <code><a href=acquired.html>acquired</a></code>
     function is used to wait for it to complete (or fail).
<pre>
 tpzero all, all
 until $acquired(channels)
</pre>

<P>
<DT> Context:
<DD> The BICEP has 13 receivers (rx0..rx12) whose 10GHz bandpasses are
     split into 10 bands (band0..band9) by a channelizer. The
     resulting 130 signal paths are refered to as channels. The
     corresponding correlators contain total power detectors that
     produce voltage outputs that reflect their input powers. The
     <code>tpzero</code> measures the zero offsets of these detector
     outputs by turning off the IF amplifiers that feed the correlator
     inputs for a full integration, then measuring the resulting total
     power outputs in raw ADC counts. These numbers are recorded in the
     archive and are used by the channelizer task when asked to set
     the total power correlator inputs to a specified level. Since the
     process takes a couple of integrations to complete the control
     program is notified on completion and the
     <code>$acquired(tp)</code> then returns <code>true</code>.
<P>
     Note that if any command that involves the channelizer, such as
     the <code><a href=channel.html>channel</a></code>,
     <code><a href=attenuate.html>attenuate</a></code>,
     <code><a href=channelizer.html>channelizer</a></code>,
     <code><a href=tp.html>tp</a></code> or another
     <code><a href=tpzero.html>tpzero</a></code> command, is initiated
     before a previous <code>tpzero</code> (or <code>tp</code>) command is
     complete, the new command replaces the previous one, but only in
     those channels that are common to both commands. In particular
     the &quot;<code>channelizer off</code>&quot; command cancels any
     ongoing commands in all channels.
