<P>
Create a new scalar variable and assign it an initial value.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code>name</code>
     <DD> The name to give the variable. This must be unique within
          the current block of commands (see below).
     <DT> <code>value</code>
     <DD> The value to give the variable. This can be any expression
          that is compatible with the specified datatype.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example declares a string variable, then prints it.
<pre>
 String s = &quot;This is a test string.\n&quot;
 print $s
</pre>

<DT> Example 2:
<DD> The following example shows the effect of declaring two
     variables with identical names in nested blocks of commands.  The
     <code>text</code> variable is declared both outside the <code><a
     href=while.html>while</a>()</code> loop and within it. This results
     in two variables, one that is only visible to statements within
     the body of the <code>while()</code> loop, and another that is
     potentially visible in both places but becomes hidden by the
     nested declaration until the the loop completes. Note that
     statements in the while loop that precede the nested declaration
     see the outer declaration.
<pre>
 <b>String text = &quot;Outer.\n&quot;</b>
 print &quot;A &quot;, $text
 while($iteration &lt; 1) {
   print &quot;B &quot;, $text
   <b>String text = &quot;Nested.\n&quot;</b>
   print &quot;C &quot;, $text
 }
 print &quot;D &quot;, $text
</pre>

This produces the following output:

<pre>
 A Outer
 B Outer
 C Nested
 D Outer
</pre>

<DT> Context:
<DD> Variables can be declared anywhere in a script, but they must
     have unique names within the enclosing block of commands.
     A block of commands is a group of commands that are enclosed
     within braces. Examples are the bodies of loops, the bodies of
     <code><a href=if.html>if</a></code> statements, and the bodies of
     user-defined commands.
