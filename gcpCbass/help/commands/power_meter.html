<P>
Send a command to the noise-cal power-meter.
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/PowerMeterCommand.html>PowerMeterCommand</a> command</b></code>
     <DD> The type of command to send to the power meter.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example 1:
<DD> The following example tells the power meter to reset to its
     power-on defaults.

<pre>
  power_meter reset
</pre>

<DT> Example 2:
<DD> The following example tells the power meter to perform a zero
     calibration.

<pre>
  power_meter zero
</pre>

     Note that with the current power meter, while the zero-calibration
     process only takes between 15 seconds and a minute, it apparently
     takes much longer than that for the power meter measurements to
     settle down. The noise-cal task waits for a minute after
     starting a zero calibration before resuming its periodic readout
     of the measured power.
<P>
<DT> Example 3:
<DD> The following example tells the power meter to take a new power
     reading and record it in the noise.power archive register. This
     is only useful during testing, because usually the power meter is
     automatically read out at the rate set by the
     <a href=noise_readout_interval.html>noise_readout_interval</a>
     command.

<pre>
  power_meter read
</pre>

<P>
<DT> Context:
<DD> The noise-calibration system uses a dedicated gpib power-meter to
     measure the power output of its noise-generator. The power_meter
     command allows one to send simple commands to it. More complex
     commands can alternatively be sent with the <a
     href=gpib_send.html>gpib_send</a> command (the GPIB address of the
     power meter is currently 13). See the power meter manual for
     details about the commands that are available.
