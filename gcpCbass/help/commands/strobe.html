<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> (none)
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example causes the current values of the BICEP
     registers to be recorded for monitoring and archival.
<pre>
  strobe
</pre>

<DT> Context:
<DD> Normally the antenna control scanner task takes a snapshot of the BICEP
     registers whenever it receives an interrupt from the system timing
     generator. This command can be used to request a snapshot without
     the system timing generator running. If the control program stops
     receiving data from the scanner, this command can be used to
     determine whether the system timing generator has stopped sending
     interrupts or whether the scanner has died.
