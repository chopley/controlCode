<P>
Control the receiver simulation box.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Mandatory Arguments:
<DD> (none)
<DT> Optional Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><a href=../dataTypes/Receivers.html>Receivers</a> noise</code>
     <DD> The set of receivers to pass noise to.
     <DT><code><a href=../dataTypes/SwitchState.html>SwitchState</a> signal</code>
     <DT><code><a href=../dataTypes/Receivers.html>Receivers</a> quad</code>
     <DD> The set of receivers whose phases are to be shifted by 90 degrees.
     </DL>

<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example connects noise sources to the inputs of
     all receivers and turns on the fake sky signal. It leaves the
     quadrature phase switch settings unchanged.
<pre>
  rxsim noise=all, signal=on
</pre>

<DT> Example 2:
<DD> The following example turns off the noise sources of all
     receivers, but doesn't change the quadrature phase switch states
     or the state of the fake sky signal.

<pre>
  rxsim noise=none
</pre>

<DT> Example 3:
<DD> The final example turns on the quadrature phase switch of
     receivers 0 and 2 and turns off the quadrature phase switches of
     the rest of the antennas.

<pre>
  rxsim quad=rx1+rx2
</pre>

<DT> Context:
<DD> To correlator test box contains 13 noise sources which simulate
     the noise generated by each of the BICEP receivers. It also
     contains a common signal generator that can be injected into
     either all or none of the correlator reciever inputs. Finally a
     90 degree phase shifter can selectively be inserted into the
     signal paths of each correlator input. This box is controlled by
     the <code>rxsim</code> command via a digital I/O board.
