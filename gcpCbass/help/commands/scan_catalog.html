<h2>The <span class=command>scan_catalog</span> command (usage)</h2>
<hr>


<h2><i>Context:</i></h2><p>

The scan_catalog command loads the list of scans in filename into the control system.
It must be executed before the <a class=plain href="scan.html">scan</a> command
can be used.

<p>

Each entry in the scan catalog consits of a scan type, NORMAL or CONTINUOUS,
a scan name, and the path to the scan file, separated by white space and terminated by a newline.
Empty lines are ignored as are comments beginning with the # character.
An alternate name for a scan can be defined by starting an entry with ALIAS followed by
an existing scan name.

<p>

A CONTINUOUS scan contains the START, BODY and END sections allowing the body to be repeated,
while a NORMAL scan does not.

<h2><i>Examples:</i></h2><p>

scan_catalog "$GCP_DIR/control/scan/scan.cat"
