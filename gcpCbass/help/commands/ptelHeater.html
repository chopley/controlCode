<h2>The <span class=command>ptelHeater</span> command (usage)</h2>
<hr>


<h2><i>Context:</i></h2><p>

The ptelHeater command turns the heater on a pointing telescope on or off or sets the
temperature set point or parameters for PID control loop.
Note that the heaters are wired with a thermostat to turn on if the
temperature falls below a fixed minimum, even if they are turned off by
this command, in order to prevent the electronics from being damaged
by freezing.

<h2><i>Examples:</i></h2><p>

<pre>
ptelHeater 0, on    # Turn pointing telescope 0 heater on and disable PID loop
ptelHeater 1, off   # Turn pointing telescope 1 heater off and disable PID loop
ptelHeater all, off  # Turn all pointing telescope heaters off 
ptelHeater 0, pid, temp=10.5 # Enable PID loop for pointing telescope 0 and set temperature set point to 10.5 degrees C
ptelHeater 0, tune, p=0.2, i=0.001, d=1000.0 # Set proportional, integral and derivative parameters of PID loop for telescope 0
</pre>

<p>
The PID loop parameters are remembered when the PID loop is disabled, and the PID continues to monitor the temperature
and calculate the PID loop output, except that the PID output has no effect on the heater.
The temperature set point is not remembered when the PID loop is disabled.
The PID control loop for each telecope sets its heater duty cycle in 100 millisecond increments over a 20 second period.
The heater on/off register only samples the heater state once a second, so it is not a precise indication of the heater state
when in PID loop mode.
