<P>
Insert a given attenuation into the signal path of one or more channels.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Optional qualifier arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code>/add</code>
     <DD> If this modifier is present the attenuation will be added to the
          existing value. Otherwise it will replace it.
     </DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Receivers.html>Receivers</a> receivers</b></code>
     <DD> The set of receivers to target.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Bands.html>Bands</a> bands</b></code>
     <DD> The set of frequency bands to target.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Attenuation.html>Attenuation</a> attenuation</b></code>
     <DD> The attenuation to insert into the specified channels.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example 1:
<DD> The following example inserts the maximum programmable
     attenuation into the signal path of every channel.
<pre>
 attenuate all, all, 31
</pre>

<DT> Example 2:
<DD> The next example inserts 10db of attenuation into all channels
     whose signals originate from receiver 4.
<pre>
 attenuate rx4, all, 10
</pre>

<DT> Example 3:
<DD> This example reduces the attenuation to band 4 from
     all receivers by 10db.
<pre>
 attenuate/add all, band4, -10
</pre>

<P>
<DT> Context:
<DD> The BICEP has 13 receivers (rx0..rx12) whose 10GHz bandpasses are
     split into 10 bands (band0..band9) by a channelizer. The
     resulting 130 signal paths are refered to as channels. Every
     channel contains a programmable attenuator for setting the
     input power to the corresponding correlator input. The amount of
     attenuation needed by each channel depends on the sensitivity of
     the various components in the signal path and the brightness of
     the source. For bright planets more attenuation will be needed
     than when observing the CMB. Normally this attenuation should be
     set by using the <code><a href=tp.html>tp</a></code> command to
     request a given input power level, but it can also be set
     explicitly through the <code>attenuate</code> command.
<P>
     Note that all of the attenuators are set to maximum attenuation
     when the control system starts.
<P>
     This command can be used to add and then remove attenuation
     when going to the calibration transmitter.
     However note that if a /add causes values to hit the 0 and 31 db 
     limits then doing a /add with the same number of opposite sign
     will not restore the previous state.
