<P>
Replace or add to the sky-based tracking offsets.

<DL>
<DT> Optional qualifier arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code>/add</code>
     <DD> If this modifier is present the offsets will be added to the
          existing offsets. Otherwise they will replace them.
     </DL>
<DT> Mandatory arguments:
<DD> (none)
<DT> Optional Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/PointingOffset.html>PointingOffset</a> y</b></code>
     <DD> The offset towards the zenith, directed along the great circle that
          connects the un-offset pointing center and the zenith.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/PointingOffset.html>PointingOffset</a> x</b></code>
     <DD> The offset along the great circle that is both perpendicular to
          the above described y axis and passes through the un-offset
          pointing center. When the telescope is pointing south, x
          increases towards the west.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Antennas.html>Antennas</a> ant</b></code>
     <DD> A set of one or more antennas to which the command should be applied.
     <DD> Default is controlled by the <code><a href=setDefault../dataTypes/Antennas.html>setDefaultAntennas</a> command.

     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Examples:
<DD> The following example adds an additional 10 arcseconds to the
     pointing offset along the x axis and 0.02 degrees to the offset
     along the y axis.

<pre>
  sky_offset/add x=0:0:10, y=0.02
</pre>

     The second example shows how to replace any existing sky offsets
     with new sky offsets. In this case both are being set to zero, to
     remove all sky offsets.

<pre>
  sky_offset/set x=0, y=0
</pre>

<DT>Context:
<DD>The sky_offset command is designed for use when measuring the
    primary beams of the individual antennas. It allows one to define
    a regular grid in x and y over the area of the primary beam and
    point a source at each of these locations. Unlike the raw
    telescope-based offsets that are established with the <a
    href=offset.html>offset</a> command, the sky_offset command
    maintains the same part of the beam pointing at the source
    irrespective of the elevation and declination of the source.
<P>
    Sky based offsets are implemented as offsets along two orthogonal
    great circles that pass through the un-offset pointing center. The
    orientation of these great circles is established by defining one
    of them to be the great circle that joins the un-offset pointing
    center and the zenith. The offset angle along this great circle is
    refered to as an x-axis offset. The other great circle is uniquely
    defined simply by the fact that it must go through the un-offset
    pointing center at right angles to the x-axis great circle. At
    zero elevation the second great circle follows the horizon, and it
    then increases in the same direction as the telescope azimuth.
