<DT> Context:
<DD> Every second the antenna control cpu reads the date and time from a GPS
     time-code-reader. Unfortunately this doesn't include the year
     number, so at startup this information is automatically sent to
     the control system by the control program, using the year read
     from the control-sun clock. Thereafter at the start of a new
     year, the control system should either be restarted, or the
     <code>update_year</code> command should be invoked. In either
     case the year to be sent will be deduced from the control-sun
     clock, so be sure that the control sun's clock has rolled over in
     UTC before running this command.
