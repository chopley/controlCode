<DT> Arguments:
<p>
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/PagerState.html>PagerState</a> state</b></code>
     <DD> The desired state of the pager.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Ip.html>Ip</a> ip</b></code> 
     <DD> The IP address associated with the iServer device
     controlling the pager.
     <DT><code><b><a href=Pager../dataTypes/Dev.html>PagerDev</a> dev</b></code>
     <DD> The device whose IP address we wish to modify.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example: <DD> 
<p>
The following example tells the control program
that the rotating red light in MAPO is connected to an iServer device
with IP address <code> 128.135.70.254</code>, enables paging, and
activates all devices under the control of the pager:

<dl>
<dt><pre>
<dd>pager chip, ip=128.135.70.254, dev=mapo_redlight
pager enable
pager on
</pre>
</dl>

<P>
<DT> Context: <DD> 
<p>
When a pager is connected to an iServer ethernet
server attached to the network, pager devices can be activated by
remote viewer clients, either manually, by issuing the <code>pager
on</code> command, or by an out-of-range register in a viewer
monitor page.
<p>
The viewer register dialog box lets you specify a min/max value for
any register, outside of which the register will be visually flagged.
An additional checkbutton in the same dialog box lets you activate
a pager when the register goes out of range.  The dialog also lets you
specify the number of consecutive frames during which the register
must be out of range before the pager is activated.
<p>
Once a register activates the pager, <i>all</i> viewer clients are
forbidden from sending further paging requests until the <code>pager
enable</code> command is issued.  If the <code>pager disable</code>
command has been issued, no paging requests will be honored until the
<code>pager enable</code> command is reissued.  The pager will always
be activated when the <code>pager on</code> is issued directly.
<p>
The planned implementation is to attach pager devices to a digital I/O
module controlled by an iServer ethernet server.  This is a network
device which can be addressed via a hardwired IP address, and will
translate data sent over a TCP/IP socket connection to serial output.
When the user sets the correct IP address of a connected iServer
module using the <code>pager chip</code> command, issuing the
<code>pager on</code> command will set all output bits of the I/O
module to a high state.  Issuing the <code>pager off</code> command
will set all output bits to low.

Currently the <code>pager</code> command supports two devices, a
rotating red light located in MAPO, and a pager base station located
inside the dome.
