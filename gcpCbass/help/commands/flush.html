<P>
Flush buffered data to the current archive or log file.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Mandatory Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/ArcFile.html>ArcFile</a> file</b></code>
     <DD> The type of file to flush (archive or log).
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Examples:
<DD> The following example flushes all received data from the stdio
     buffers of the current archive file to disk.

<pre>
  flush archive
</pre>

<P>

<DT>Context:
<DD> To improve writing performance, archive data received from the
     antenna control cpu is buffered so that it can be written to the
     archive file in large &quot;chunks&quot;. This has the
     disadvantage that the disk file lags behind what has actually
     been received, and the last recorded frame is likely to be
     incomplete until the next time the buffer is flushed. The flush
     command forces one of these flushes. If data is still coming from
     the antenna control cpu, this is somewhat pointless because buffering
     will resume with the next frames, but if the antenna control CPU is
     shutdown and one wants to make a copy of what was archived before
     the CPU was shutdown, then can be useful. Note that flushing also
     occurs when the file is closed.
<P>
     Note that although the flush command can be called upon to flush
     log files, this should be unnecessary because when log files are
     opened the open command asks the I/O system to make them line
     buffered.
