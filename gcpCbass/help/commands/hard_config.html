<H1>BICEP Hardware Configuration Commands.</H1>

When the control program is started it reads and compiles a script
called:

<pre>
 $BICEP_DIR/bicepAntennaControl.init
</pre>

Where <code>BICEP_DIR</code> is an environment variable defined by the
caller's shell. Then when communication between the antenna control CPU and
the control program is first established, and thereafter after each
reboot of the antenna control CPU, the control program executes this script
to configure the BICEP hardware.

<P>
The commands that were designed with this script in mind are listed in
the contents page under the title &quot;<a
href="../index.html#hard_conf_list">Hardware Configuration Commands</a>
&quot;.
<P>
The following is an anemic example of a hardware configuration script.

<pre>
 # This schedule is executed by the control program whenever communication
 # is (re-)established with the antenna control CPU.

 print "Hardware initialization script started.\n"

 # Set the number of hardware intervals per hardware readout.

 integrate 11

 # Set the noise-calibration power-readout.

 noise_readout_interval 1m

 # Tell the antenna control scanner that it can start taking data.

 inhibit false

 print "The hardware initialization script completed.\n"

</pre>
