<font color=blue><code><b>encoder_zero_points</b> az_zero, el_zero, dk_zero</code></font>
<P>
Specify the encoder angles at zero azimuth, elevation and deck angle.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/PointingOffset.html>PointingOffset</a> az</b></code>
     <DD> The azimuth encoder angle that corresponds to zero azimuth,
          measured in the direction of increasing azimuth.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/PointingOffset.html>PointingOffset</a> el</b></code>
     <DD> The elevation encoder angle that corresponds to zero elevation,
          measured in the direction of increasing elevation.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/PointingOffset.html>PointingOffset</a> dk</b></code>
     <DD> The deck encoder angle that corresponds to the chosen zero
          point of the deck axis, measured in the direction of
	  increasing deck angle.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example tells the control system that when the
     telescope is pointing north, the azimuth encoder actually reads
     10.5 degrees. Also that when the telescope is pointing at zero
     elevation that the elevation encoder reports an elevation of -4.3
     degrees. And finally that when the deck encoder reads -50.0
     degrees the deck angle should be considered to be zero.

<pre>
 encoder_zero_points 10.5, -4.3, -50.0
</pre>

<P>
<DT> Context:
<DD> The angles at which azimuth and elevation encoders report zero
     counts do not correspond to the zeroes of topocentric azimuth and
     elevation. This is both because manually positioning the encoders
     to arcsecond accuracy is virtually impossible, and because the
     zero points will gradually change as the telescope base sinks and
     other parts of the telescope relax. Instead these zero points are
     deduced by offline software while fitting the pointing model of
     the telescope, ready to be installed with the encoder_zero_points
     command.
<P>
     Note that after a reboot the control system will refuse to track
     a source or slew the telescope until this command has been
     called, so this should be done from the
     <code>$BICEP_DIR/conf/bicepAntennaControl.init</code> boot script.
