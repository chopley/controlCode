<P>
Switch off, or move one or more of the receiver phase-shifter motors.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Receivers.html>Receivers</a> ant</b></code>
     <DD> The set of receivers whose motors are to be controlled.
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/PhaseStep.html>PhaseStep</a> step</b></code>
     <DD> The step size, from:
          <UL>
          <LI> <code><b>full</b></code> - Full steps of the stepper motor.
          <LI> <code><b>half</b></code> - Half steps of the stepper motor.
          </UL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/PhaseShift.html>PhaseShift</a>
     position</b></code> <DD> The target motor encoder position
     (0..1023), or any of the words: <code>off</code>,
     <code>left</code>, or <code>right</code>. The motor moves a full
     revolution between 0 and 1024.  This corresponds to a phase
     change of 4.PI.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example moves the phase-shifter motor of receiver 3
     to encoder position 420, using full steps of the motor. It then
     waits for the motor to reach the desired position, or timeout.
     Then it turns the phase-shifter motor off.
<pre>
 pshifter rx3, full, 420
 until $acquired(phase)
 pshifter rx3, full, off
</pre>

<P>
<DT> Context:
<DD> If the specified phase-shifter motors are turned off when this
     command is invoked, they are automatically switched on before
     attempting the move. Then starting with full steps of the stepper
     motors, the phase shifters are moved as close as possible to the
     desired position. Then, if half-step mode has been requested, and
     the requested position is closer to a neighboring half step, then
     the two coils of the bracketing steps are energized to hold the
     motor half way between them.
<P>
     Note that half-step mode requires that the motor coils be
     continuously energized, whereas full-step mode doesn't. This
     means that after reaching a target using full steps, the motor
     can be switched off. If you switch it off when in half step mode,
     the motor may slip by half a step.
