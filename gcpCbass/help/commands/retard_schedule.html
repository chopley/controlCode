<font color=blue><code><b>retard_schedule</b> index number</code></font>
<P>
Move a schedule one or more entries towards the back of the schedule queue.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><a href=../dataTypes/QueueEntry.html>QueueEntry</a> index</code>
     <DD> The queue index of the schedule to be moved.
     <DT><code><a href=../dataTypes/Count.html>Count</a> number</code>
     <DD> The number of queue positions to advance the schedule.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example moves entry 0 in the queue of pending
     schedules to entry 2, allowing the schedule that previously was
     in entry 1 to advance to entry 0.

<pre>
  retard_schedule 0, 2
</pre>

<DT> Context:
<DD> The <code><a
     href=schedule.html>schedule</a></code> command queues scheduling
     scripts to be executed in the order that they are queued. If
     it then turns out that some of the scripts in the queue
     need to be run before a particular script that is nearer to the
     front of the queue, then the <code>retard_schedule</code>
     command can be used to move it one or more entries further back
     in the queue. Note that this can also be done interactively in
     the topmost pane of the main viewer window.
