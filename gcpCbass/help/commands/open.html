<font color=blue><a name="open"> <code><b>open</b> directory</code> </a></font>
<P>
Open a new archive, log or frame grabber file.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Mandatory Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/ArcFile.html>ArcFile</a> file</b></code>
     <DD> The type of file to create (archive, log or grabber).
     </DL>
<DT> Optional Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=../dataTypes/Wdir.html>Wdir</a> directory</b></code>
     <DD> The full name of the directory in which the archive file
	  is to be opened. This must must be writable by the
	  control program. If this argument is omitted the specified
	  file will be created in the current default directory for
	  that type of file. If a directory was specified on a
	  previous call to <code>open</code> for the specified file
	  type, that directory will be used. Otherwise the file will
	  be opened in the directory from which the the control program program
	  was launched.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example first opens archive and log files in
     specified subdirectories of the /scr/bicep directory. Subsequently
     it opens new versions of these files in the same directories
     (which has the side effect of closing the previous files).
<pre>
  open archive, dir=/scr/bicep/data
  open log, dir=/scr/bicep/log
  ...
  open archive
  open log
</pre>

<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example tells the control program to save subsequent 
     frame grabber images to disk.  When a new image is received from the 
     frame grabber, it will be saved in the specified subdirectory of the 
     /scr/bicep directory.  In the case of frame grabber images, each image
     is saved to a separate file.
<pre>
  open grab, dir=/scr/bicep/data/images
</pre>
<P>

<DT>Context:
<DD> When the control program starts, archive frames and log messages
     are not recorded on disk. To have them be written to files, the
     <code>open</code> must be used. By default these are written in
     the directory from which the the control program program was started, but
     this may be overriden by using the optional <code>dir</code>
     argument to specify alternative destination directories. Once
     an alternative directory has been specified, this becomes the
     default directory for subsequent open commands for files of the
     same type.
<P>
     Note that opening a new file automatically closes any existing
     file of the same type.
<P>
     Also note that the names of log, archive and grab files are not
     settable by the user. Instead they are composed from file
     creation date and time as follows: 

      yyyymmdd_hhmmss.eee

     where yyyy is the four digit year, mm is the two digit
     month-number (1-12), dd is the day number within the month
     (1-31), hh is the hour into the day (0-23), mm is the minute into
     the hour (0-59), ss is the second into the minute (0-59), and eee
     is a three letter extension that enumerates the file type. The
     extension is .dat for archive data files, .log for log files, and
     .fit for frame grabber images.
<P>
     The file names are used when reading archive files to determine
     which files to search in for data of a given time, so you
     shouldn't rename them.
