<DL>
     <DT><code><b><a href=WalshState.html>WalshState</a> state</b></code>
     <DD> The desired state of the slow walshing: <code>on</code> or <code>off</code>.

<DT> Context: 
<DD> 
In addition to the fast hardware Walsh switching, this command allows
removal of constant correlator offsets by performing a second level of
slow walshing of the receiver LO phases.  On each interrupt, the
phases of each receiver are modulated by 0 or 180&#176, according
to a set of period-16 Walsh functions, where my convention is -1 -->
180&#176, +1 --> 0&#176.  Each visibility is demodulated in software
with the product of the two receiver Walsh functions prior to software
integration.  The slow walshing phase shifts are combined with any
use-requested phase shifts effected with the <font color=blue><a
href=quad.html>quad</a></font> and only the user-requested values
appear in the <code>rx.lo_quad</code> registers.
<p>
Since a change of phase of 180&#176 in one LO results in a sign change
of the visibility, any constant offset from the correlator will cancel
over a complete period of the walsh functions, since the product of
any two walsh functions integrates to zero.
<p>
Note that when slow walshing is turned off, the change will not take
effect until the completion of the current walshing period (16
register snapshots).  The bitmask of receiver walsh states is recorded
in the <code>frame.walshstate</code> register.
