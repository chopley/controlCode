<P>
Import the contents of another script.
<P>
<DL>
<DT> Arguments:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT><code>filename</code>
     <DD>The name of a file containing script commands. This should
         either be a literal pathname, or the name of a script
	 <a href=../dataTypes/InputFile.html>InputFile</a> argument preceded by a
	 <code>$</code>.
     </DL>
<P>
<DT> Example:
<DD> The following example imports a file that contains a number of
     convenient user-defined commands and functions.

<pre>
 import ~bicepdaq/BICEP/conf/utils.sch
</pre>
<DT> Context:
<DD> It is anticipated that over time BICEP observers will create a
     number of canned observing procedures. These will hopefully be
     encapsulated in user-defined commands that take observing lists
     as arguments. In order not to have to cut and paste them into
     every observing schedule that gets written, these commands will
     be placed in a utility file that can be imported into subsequent
     observing schedules, using the <code>import</code> command.
</DL>
