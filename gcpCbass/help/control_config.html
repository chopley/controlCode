<H1>Control Program Configuration Commands.</H1>

When the control program is started it executes a configuration script
called:

<pre>
 $GCP_DIR/sptArrayControl.init
</pre>

Where <code>GCP_DIR</code> is an environment variable defined by the
caller's shell. This script will be rejected if it contains any
commands that require communication to have been established with the
antenna control CPU. The commands that were designed with this script in
mind are listed in the contents page under the title &quot;<a
href="index.html#cntl_conf_list">Control Program Configuration
Commands</a>&quot;.
<P>
The following is an example of a control-program configuration script.

<pre>
 # This schedule is executed by sptControl on its startup.
 # Commands that need a connection to the control system will not
 # succeed.

 print "Running sptControl startup script.\n"

 # Load the source catalog.

 catalog ~sptdaq/spt/ephem/source.cat

 # Load the ephemeris of UT1-UTC.

 ut1utc ~sptdaq/spt/ephem/ut1utc.ephem

 # Specify the location of the SPT.

 site -118:07:20.1, 34:08:23.9, 366.0

 # Set the number of hardware readouts to integrate for each archive frame.

 archive 10

 # Create a new archive file in ~sptdaq/spt/data/

 arcdir ~sptdaq/spt/data/

 # Create a new log file in ~sptdaq/spt/logs/

 logdir ~sptdaq/spt/logs/

 print "The startup script completed.\n"

</pre>
