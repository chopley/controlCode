<H1>The archiving status window</H1>

<P>

The archiving status window shows the file name of the current
archiving file, if any, and the current operating parameters of
the archiver. These include the following.

<UL>
<LI><b>Archive directory</b>
<BR> This is the directory in which subsequently opened archive files
     will be placed. 
<LI><b>Combine</b>
<BR> The number of snapshots that are being combined per archived
     record.
<LI><b>Max file size</b>
<BR> The number of records to write to the current archive file before
     closing it and starting a new one.
<LI><b>Archive filtering</b>
<BR> When this has the value, <b>on</b>, it means that only <a
     href=../mark.html>marked</a> records are being written to the
     archive file. 
</UL>

All of these parameters can be changed with the <a
href=../archive.html>archive</a> control command.
