To display live data from the control program and/or arrange for
commands entered in the <a href=command_window.html>command window</a>
to be sent to the control program, one first needs to connect to the
control program. This involves pulling down the <b>File</b> menu of
the main sptViewer window and selecting &quot;<b>Connect to the
control program</b>&quot;. This displays a dialog for specifying the
name of the computer that the control program is running on, whether
to connect for control and/or monitoring purposes, the calibration
file to use to calibrate the incoming data, and whether to append or
merge subsequent monitor data from the control program with any data
that are already in the buffer.

<P>

The calibration file contains scale factors and offsets for converting
register values from archive units to convenient display units. Unless
a calibration file was <a href=command_line.html>specified
explicitly</a> when the program was started, the calibration file
entry will initially be set to the default of
<code>$GCP_DIR/conf/cal</code>, and you shouldn't need to change this
unless you need to create a custom calibration file for an experiment.
