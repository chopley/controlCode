The configuration of the viewer, its plots and its textual display
pages, can be saved and restored by means of configuration files. The
configurations of plots and pages can either be saved individually via
the <b>File</b> menus of these windows, or one can save them all in
a single file by pulling down the <b>File</b> menu of the main
sptViewer window and selecting &quot;<b>Save Configuration
File</b>&quot;. The dialog that this reveals allows you to specify the
name of the output configuration file. By convention, such files have
extensions of <code>.cnf</code>.

<P>

To restore a previously saved configuration</a>, pull down the
<b>File</b> menu of the main sptViewer window and select &quot;<b>Load
Configuration File</b>. This will bring up a dialog for specification
of the file name of the configuration file to load. Pressing the
<b>Replace</b> button of this dialog will result in any existing plots
and pages being deleted before the new configuration is read. If
instead you want to add the plots and pages created by the
configuration file, to those that are already there, press the
<b>Merge</b> button.
