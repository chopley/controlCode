<H1>The schedule queue window</H1>

<P>

The schedule-queue status window shows the contents of the schedule
queue, as well as showing the script that is currently running.

<P>

The topmost line of this window shows the currently running schedule,
to the right of a small area that either says <b>-></b>, or
<b>S</b>. The former of these two designations says that the script is
currently running, whereas the second says that execution of the
script has temporarily been suspended.

<P>
<H2>Interactive options</H2>

There are a number of operations that one can perform in the schedule
status window. All involve clicking the right mouse button over one of
the scheduling scripts. This then displays a menu of options that can
be performed on the indicated file. The menu that is displayed when
one clicks over the currently running schedule, includes the following
options:

<UL>
<LI> <b>Abort schedule</b> - This aborts execution of the indicated
                             schedule, allowing the next schedule in
                             the queue to start running.
<LI> <b>Suspend schedule</b> - This temporarily suspends execution of
                               the current schedule.
<LI> <b>Resume schedule</b> - This resumes execution of a schedule
                              that was previously suspended.
</UL>

The menu that is displayed when one clicks over a schedule that is
waiting in the schedule queue, includes the following options:

<UL>
<LI> <b>Discard schedule</b> - This removes the indicated schedule
                               from the schedule queue.
<LI> <b>Advance by one entry</b> - This moves the indicated schedule
                                   one place towards the front of the
                                   queue, swapping places with the
                                   schedule that was due to be
                                   executed before it.
<LI> <b>Retard by one entry</b> - This moves the indicated schedule
                                   one place towards the back of the
                                   queue, swapping places with the
                                   schedule that was due to be
                                   executed after it.
