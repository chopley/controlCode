The antenna control control system samples and archives about 3000 different
quantities pertaining to its status. This includes information
pertaining to the health of the instrument, environmental information,
such as the current weather conditions, and the current time, where
the telescope is pointing, and the output data of the correlator to be
processed off-line. These quantities are refered to as registers, and
are identified by the board that they belong to, and their name. Many
of these registers are arrays. Thus <code>corr0.tp[4]</code> refers to
element 4 of the total power registers on correlator board 0. More
specifically register specifications can have the following syntaxes:

<UL>
<LI> <b>board.name</b>
<BR> This refers to all of the elements in a register called
     <u>name</u> on the board named <u>board</u>.

<LI> <b>board.name[index]</b>
<BR> This selects array element <u>index</u> of the <u>board.name</u>
     register.


<LI> <b>board.name[index1-index2]</b>
<BR> This selects all array elements between <u>index1</u> and
     <u>index2</u> of the <u>board.name</u> register.

<LI> <b>board.name.aspect</b>
<BR> This selects all elements of the <u>board.name</u> register after
     combining neighboring pairs of elements to form the type of value
     specified by <u>aspect</u>. This can only be used with
     <b>complex</b> and <b>utc</b> registers.

     <H4>Complex Register Aspects</H4>

     The following combinational aspect names are supported for
     complex registers.

     <UL>
     <LI><b>real</b>  -  The real part of a complex pair of register elements.
     <LI><b>imag</b>  -  The imaginary part of a complex pair of
                         register elements.
     <LI><b>amp</b>   -  The amplitude of a complex pair of register elements.
     <LI><b>phase</b> -  The phase of a complex pair of register
                         elements.
     </UL>

     <H4>UTC Register Aspects</H4>

     The following combinational aspect names are supported for
     registers that contain the date and time in Universal coordinated
     time. By convention all such registers are named <code><u>board</u>.utc</code>.

     <UL>
     <LI><b>date</b>  -  The Modified Julian Day number part of the register.
     <LI><b>time</b>  -  The time part of the register in hours.
     </UL>
<P>

<LI> <b>board.name.aspect[index]</b>
<BR> This selects the <u>index</u>'th pair of register elements after
     they have been combined as described above for board.name. Thus
     <code>corr0.vis.amp[3]</code> selects the amplitude of the complex
     register pair <code>(corr0.vis[6],corr0.vis[7])</code>.

<LI> <b>board.name.aspect[index1-index2]</b>
<BR> This selects the <u>index1</u>'th to <u>index2</u>'th pairs of
     register elements after they have been combined as described
     above for board.name.
</UL>
