Rows can be added and deleted by clicking the middle mouse button
anywhere within a page and selecting the corresponding operation from
the menu that this displays.

<H2>Deleting a row</H2>

To delete an existing row, and its contents, place the mouse cursor
over the unwanted row, click the middle mouse button to display the
row/col modification menu, and select the &quot;<b>Delete
Row</b>&quot; option. This will delete the row and result in all of
the rows that were below it being moved up by one row.

<H2>Inserting a new row.</H2>

To add a new row, place the mouse cursor over one of the rows that is
next to where you want the new row to appear. Then click the left
mouse button to bring up the row/col modification menu, and select
either the &quot;<b>Insert row above</b>&quot; or the &quot;<b>Insert
row below</b>&quot; options depending on whether you want the row to
appear above or below the existing row. This will create an empty row,
ready to have labels and register display fields added to it.
