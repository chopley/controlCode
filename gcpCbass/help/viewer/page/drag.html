Labels and register display fields can be moved from one location on
the page to another by dragging them with the mouse. To start such an
operation one first has to select the fields that are to be
moved. This is simply a matter of holding down the left mouse button
while moving the mouse cursor over the chosen fields, then letting
go. As one does this, the selected fields are highlighted by swapping
their foreground and background colors. Next move the mouse cursor
over the first of the highlighted fields, and hold down the left mouse
button again while dragging the selected fields to a new place on the
grid. When you let go of the mouse button, the selected fields will be
dropped at the new location. If there were any fields under the drop
zone, they will be deleted first.
