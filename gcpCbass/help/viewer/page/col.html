Columns can be added, deleted or resized by clicking the middle mouse
button anywhere within a page and selecting the corresponding
operation from the menu that this displays.
<P>
<H2>Deleting a column</H2>

To delete an existing column, and its contents, place the mouse cursor
over the unwanted column, click the middle mouse button to display the
row/column modification menu, and select the &quot;<b>Delete
Column</b>&quot; option. This will delete the column, and result in
all of the columns that were to its right being moved one column to
the left.

<H2>Inserting a new column.</H2>

To add a new column, place the mouse cursor over one of the columns
that is next to where you want the new column to appear. Then click
the left mouse button to bring up the row/column modification menu,
and select either the &quot;<b>Insert column left</b>&quot; or the
&quot;<b>Insert column right</b>&quot; options depending on which side of the
existing column you want the new column to appear. This will create an
empty column with the <a href=gen.html#colwidth>default width</a>.

<H2>Changing the width of a column.</H2>

When a new column is created, it is given a <a
href=gen.html#colwidth>default width</a>. If the labels or register
values displayed in this column exceed the default width, then some of
their text will be truncated by the edges of the column.
<P>
To fix this you can either explicitly set the width of the column, or
ask to have the column width set to the minimum width needed to
accomodate the longest label or register value currently displayed in
the column. In both cases, click the middle mouse button over the
column of interest, and from the menu that this displays, select
either &quot;<b>Set column width</b>&quot; or &quot;<b>Fit column
width</b>&quot; respectively. The former of these two will display a
dialog allowing you to see the current width and enter a new width,
whereas the second will immediately adjust the column width according
to the current contents of the column.

<P>

Column widths are specified as the number of <em>average sized
characters</em> to allow for. As a result the actual width depends on
the <a href=gen.html#font>chosen font</a>. Since all characters have
slightly different widths, there may be occasions where, after having
the width determined automatically, you have to manually set it to
accomodate one character more or less.
