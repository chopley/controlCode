<center><H1>The CBASS viewer program</H1></center>

The <code>cbassViewer</code> program provides array control monitoring and
control of the control system. It can also be used to inspect the
contents of the archive.

<H2>Starting the program</H2>

Provided that your path includes the location of the CBASS software,
starting the viewer program can be as simple as typing:

<pre>
  cbassViewer
</pre>

Other <a href=command_line.html>command-line options</a> are also
avaialable for specifying sources of data and configuration files.


<H2>The main window</H2>

The main window of <code>cbassViewer</code> is split into 4 parts, the
<a href=main_menu.html>main menu bar</a>, the <a
href=schedule_window.html>schedule queue</a> window, the <a
href=archive_window.html>archive status</a> window, the <a
href=log_window.html>log output window</a>, and the <a
href=command_window.html>command input window</a>. These are
documented separately.

<H2>Monitoring the state of the CBASS</H2>

The antenna control control system samples and archives about 3000 different
quantities pertaining to its status. This includes information
pertaining to the health of the instrument, environmental information,
such as the current weather conditions, and the current time, where
the telescope is pointing, and the output data of the correlator. The
values of these registers can be monitored both graphically and
textually. The former is useful if you need to see how a register is
changing as a function of time, or how it changes relative to a
another register, whereas the latter is useful for showing the current
state of the instrument.
