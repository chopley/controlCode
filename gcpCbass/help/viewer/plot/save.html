To allow a given plot to be recreated at a later date, one can save
the configuration of the plot to a file. There are two ways to do
this.

<OL>
<LI> You can save the configuration of the viewer, thus saving the
     configurations of all its plots and plots in one file. This
     involves pulling down the <b>File</b> menu of the sptViewer
     main window and selecting <b>Save configuration file</b> to
     bring up the &quot;Save configuration&quot; dialog.
<LI> Or you can save the configuration of an individual plot in a file
     by pulling down the <b>File</b> menu of the plot itself, and
     selecting <b>Save Plot Configuration</b>. This will bring up a
     dialog in which to specify the name of the output configuration
     file.
</OL>

In either case the file that is generated can later be reloaded via
the viewer's &quot;<a href=../save_config.html>load
configuration</a>&quot; dialog.
