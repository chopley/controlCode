<center><H1>Zooming and autoscaling the X-axis of a plot</H1></center>

To interactively modify the x-axis range of a plot, start by switching
to the x-zoom cursor-input mode, either by pressing the
&quot;<b>x</b>&quot; key within the plot window, or by pulling down
the <b>Cursor</b> menu of the plot window and selecting <b>Zoom
X</b>. The cursor will change to a single vertical line. If you want
to widen the x-axis to display all of the available data, press the
right mouse button. If you want to temporarily zoom in on the x-axis,
start by moving the vertical cursor line to one end of the desired
x-axis range, and click the right mouse button. The cursor will split
into two vertical lines, one of which stays where you just clicked,
and the second of which should be moved to the other end of the
range. Upon clicking the left mouse button again, the plot will be
zoomed to display the data between the two cursor lines. At this point
if scrolling was enabled, it will temporarily be disabled until you
unzoom again. If you didn't zoom far enough, you can repeat the
above operations to zoom in further. The viewer keeps a stack of
all these nested zooms, so that unzooming takes you back to the
previous zoom limits.

<P>

<H2>Unzooming the x-axis</H2>

To unzoom the x-axis after zooming in one or more times, if you aren't
still in x-zoom cursor input mode, select it as described above, then
press the right mouse button. Each time that you press this button,
the plot will unzoom back to the previous zoom limits, until all the
nested zooms have been undone. If you then press this button again,
the plot will zoom out further to show all of the data in the plot
buffer.

<H2>Adopting zoom limits</H2>

If after zooming in, you want to forget about all nested zoom limits
and adopt the current zoom limits as the normal plot limits, press the
middle mouse button. This will update the limits shown in the <a
href=conf_plot.html>plot configuration dialog</a>, and those that are
recorded when you <a href=save.html>save</a> the plot configuration.
It will also reenable scrolling if this was enabled before you started
zooming.
