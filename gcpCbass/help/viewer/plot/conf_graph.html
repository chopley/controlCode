The graph configuration dialog is automatically displayed whenever you
create a new graph. To reconfigure a graph after it has been created,
switch to the graph reconfiguration cursor mode, either by pressing
the &quot;<b>g</b>&quot; within the plot window, or by pulling down
the <b>Cursor</b> plot menu and selecting <b>Modify Graph</b>. The
cursor will change to a cross hair. Place this cross hair over the
graph that you wish to reconfigure and press the left mouse button.
This will bring up the dialog.

 whenever To add a new graph to a plot, either
hit the &quot;<b>a</b>&quot; key on the keyboard, while the mouse
cursor is within the plot window, or pull down the <b>Configure</b>
menu of the plot window, and select <b>Add Graph</b>. In both cases, a
<a href=conf_graph.html>graph-configuration dialog</a> will be
displayed. Within this dialog you will see the following entry fields:

<UL>
<LI> <b>Registers (one per line)</b>
<BR> Each graph can be used to display multiple registers against the
     same x and y axes. The registers are specified in this field, one
     per line. When a register specification selects a register that
     contains an array of values, one can specify any contiguous range
     of elements from this register to be displayed. For example,
     given the 13 element total power register, <code>corr0.tp</code>.
<P>
     <UL>
     <LI> <b>corr0.tp</b>
     <BR> Means display all 13 elements of the array.
     <LI> <b>corr0.tp[3]</b>
     <BR> Means display just element 3 of the array. 
     <LI> <b>corr0.tp[3-5]</b>
     <BR> Means display elements 3,4 and 5 of the array.  Note that if
          the number before the hyphen had been omitted, 0 would have
          been substituted. Similarly, if the number after the hyphen
          had been omitted, the index of the last element in the
          array, (12 in this case) would have been substituted.
     </UL>

<P>
     The easiest way to select a particular register is to click on
     the green <b>list</b> button next to the register entry field.
     This results in a menu of board names being displayed, and when
     the mouse is placed over one of these board names, a sub-menu is
     displayed, listing the names of the registers on that
     board. Selecting one of these registers results in the
     corresponding register specification being appended to the list
     of selected registers. If needed, you can then edit this
     specification to specify which elements to display.

<P>
<LI> <b>Label</b>
<BR> This specifies the label to display along the y-axis of the
     graph.

<P>
<LI> <b>Range</b>
<BR> This specifies the initial limits of the y-axis.

<P>
<LI> <b>Bit numbers (eg. 0,1..)</b>
<BR> This optional field allows you to request that one or more bits
     from the least significant 32 bits of the integral part of the
     number be displayed. The values of the bits are displayed by
     showing logical 0 as the bit number minus 0.25, and logical 1 as
     0.25 plus the number of the bit. Thus if bit 12 is selected for
     display, on the graph it toggles between values of 11.75 and
     12.25.
