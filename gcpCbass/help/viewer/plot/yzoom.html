<center><H1>Zooming and autoscaling the Y-axis of a plot</H1></center>

To interactively modify the y-axis range of a graph, start by
switching to the y-zoom cursor-input mode, either by pressing the
&quot;<b>y</b>&quot; key within the plot window, or by pulling down
the <b>Cursor</b> menu of the plot window and selecting <b>Zoom
Y</b>. The cursor will change to a single horizontal line. If you want
to increase the y-axis range to reveal all of the available data that
lies between the current x-axis range, press the right mouse
button. If you want to temporarily zoom in on the y-axis of a graph,
start by moving the horizontal cursor line to one end of the desired
y-axis range within the graph, then click the right mouse button. The
cursor will split into two horizontal lines, one of which stays where
you just clicked, and the second of which should be moved to the other
end of the range. Upon clicking the left mouse button again, the plot
will be zoomed to display the data between the two cursor lines. If
you didn't zoom in as far as you wanted, you can repeat the above
operations to zoom in further. The viewer keeps a stack of all these
nested zooms, so that unzooming takes you back to the previous zoom
limits.

<P>

<H2>Unzooming the y-axis</H2>

To unzoom the y-axis after zooming in one or more times, if you aren't
still in y-zoom cursor input mode, select it as described above, then
press the right mouse button. Each time that you press this button,
the graph will unzoom back to the previous zoom limits, until all the
nested zooms have been undone. If you then press this button again,
the y-axis range will be increased just enough to reveal all of the
data that lies within the current x-axis limits.

<H2>Adopting zoom limits</H2>

If after zooming in, you want to forget about all nested zoom limits
and adopt the current zoom limits as the normal graph limits, press
the middle mouse button. This will update the limits shown in the <a
href=conf_graph.html>plot configuration dialog</a>, and those that are
recorded when you <a href=save.html>save</a> the plot configuration.
