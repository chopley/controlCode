To delete an unwanted graph, put the cursor into deletion mode by
either hitting key &quot;<b>d</b>&quot; within the plot window, or by
pulling down the <b>Cursor</b> menu of the plot window. The cursor
will be displayed as a cross hair at this point. After moving the
center of the cross hair cursor over the unwanted graph, click the
right mouse button. The graph will then disappear, and the remaining
graphs will expand to take up the vacated space. Be warned that until
a new input mode is selected from the <b>Cursor</b> menu, the cursor
remains in deletion mode after deleting a graph, so clicking a second
time would delete another graph.
