To transfer the plot to a file that can later be plotted, pull down
the <b>File</b> menu of the plot, and select <b>Hardcopy</b>. This
will bring up a dialog in which to specify the name of the output file
postfixed with a / and the name of the PGPLOT device to use. The
most useful possibilities are thus:

<UL>
<LI> <u>filename</u>/ps
<BR> Draw a grey-scale postscript plot in landscape mode to a file
     called <u>filename</u>. 
<LI> <u>filename</u>/vps
<BR> Draw a grey-scale postscript plot in portrait mode to a file
     called <u>filename</u>. 
<LI> <u>filename</u>/cps
<BR> Draw a color postscript plot in landscape mode to a file called
     <u>filename</u>. 
<LI> <u>filename</u>/vcps
<BR> Draw a color postscript plot in portrait mode to a file called
     <u>filename</u>.
