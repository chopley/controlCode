<center><H1>Requesting the identity of a given point in a graph</H1></center>

To find out the identity and value of a particular point in a graph,
start by switching to the identification cursor-input mode, either by
pressing the &quot;<b>i</b>&quot; key within the plot window, or by
pulling down the <b>Cursor</b> menu of the plot window and selecting
<b>Identify</b>. The cursor will change to cross-hairs, and
thereafter, until the cursor input mode is changed, pressing the left
mouse button anywhere within the bounds of the plot will result in the
identity and value of the nearest point to the cursor being reported
in a text area just below the plot.
