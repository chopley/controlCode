<H1>The Command-input window</H1>

<P>

The command-input window is used for sending commands to the
control-system. The available commands can be seen by typing

<pre>
  help
</pre>

in this window. To see help on a particular command, type:

<pre>
  help <u>command_name</u>
</pre>

When one types in a command that results in a reply message, or
an error message, this is displayed in the command-input window
in a different color.

<H2>Cut and paste</H2>

The command-input window supports cut and paste operations. To
select the text to be cut, click and hold the left mouse button
over the first character of the text that you want to select,
and drag until you have selected everything that is of interest.

<P>

If your selection extends over more than one line, you will notice
that the prompts are not included in the selected text. If there are
any command output messages within your selected area, you will also
notice that they are not included in the selected text. This was
designed to allow one to just cut and paste the commands without also
getting extraneous text. Similarly, if your selection starts within
output text, command input won't be included in the selected text.  To
be more specific, if one starts a selection in a particular type, of
text, such as within a prompt, a command, or a reply message, the
selection will only include similar text.

<P>

Pasting text within the window is simply a matter of pressing the
middle mouse button within the command window.

<H2>Command-line editing</H2>

The command-line editing options are modelled on those of tcsh. For
example the arrow keys can be used for recalling previous commands and
moving the cursor left or right within a given command. In the
following list of key bindings, the prefix <code>Control-</code> means
that you should hold down the Control key while pressing the key that
follows it. Similarly, the prefix <code>Meta-</code> means that you
should hold down the Meta key while pressing the key that follows
it. The Meta key on a Sun keyboard is marked with a black
diamond. Finally, a prefix of <code>Escape-</code> means that one
should press the escape key momentarily, then press the key that
follows it.
