To display data from the archive, pull down the <b>File</b> menu of
the main sptViewer window, and select &quot;<b>Load Archive Data from
Disk</b>&quot;. This brings up an archive in which you can specify the
directory in which to look for archive files, the range of times that
you are interested in, the calibration file to use to convert register
values from archive units to convenient display units, whether to
subsample the data to speed loading, whether to plot the data while
loading, instead of waiting until it has been loaded, and whether to
discard previously plotted data, or merge it with the new data.

<P>
Unless the archive directory was <a href=command_line.html>explicitly
specified</a> when the program was started, the archive directory
initially defaults to the value of <code>$GCP_ARC_DIR</code> if this
is provided, or the current directory otherwise.
<P>
The default calibration file is <code>$GCP_DIR/conf/cal</code>.
<P>
The start time should either be a blank string to request the earliest
available time in the archive, or a UTC date and time string formatted
like <b>dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss</b>, where <u>dd</u> is the integer day
of the month, <u>mmm</u> is a three letter month abbreviation,
<u>yyyy</u> is a four digit year, <u>hh</u> is the hour of day,
<u>mm</u> is the minute within the hour, and <u>ss</u> is the number
of seconds into the minute. Omitted trailing components of the time
default to zero, and if the time is omitted completely, midnight is
assumed.
<P>
The end time can be a blank string to request the latest available
time in the archive, a date and time as described above, or the name
of the computer on which the control program is running. In the latter
case data will be read from the archive, starting with the specified
start time, up until the end of the archive is reached, at which point
the viewer will connect to the control program to get future
data. This allows one to prime a antenna control plot with data from the
archive.
