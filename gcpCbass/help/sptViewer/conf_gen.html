<center><H1>Configuring general properties of the viewer</H1></center>

There are a couple of properties that globally effect the
viewer. These are the sub-sampling interval to use when reading data,
and the size of the plot buffer.

<H4>Sub-sampling the incoming data</H4>

Sub-sampling of the data can be used to speed up reading from the
archive. To disable sub-sampling, specify this as 1. A sub-sampling
interval of <u>n</u> means that every <u>n</u>'th sample is read.

<H4>Setting the size of the plot buffer</H4>

The viewer contains a circular buffer which maintains plotted data in
memory. Its size is specified as the number of register values that
can be stored in the buffer. By default this is 500000.  These 500000
elements are then divided up between all of the registers that are
being plotted. For example, if one were to have 4 graphs, each one
displaying a single register, then these 4 registers plus the x-axis
register constitute 5 registers to be stored, per snapshot received
from the control program. Thus one could display 100000 points per
graph. Beyond this point, the oldest data is deleted to make way for
new data as it arrives.  Clearly the larger you make this buffer, the
more data you will be able to display. Unfortunately enlarging the
buffer doesn't come without consequences. Excessive memory usage can
make the computer thrash when you replot a graph, and replotting or
zooming a graph with a lot of points can be painfully slow.
