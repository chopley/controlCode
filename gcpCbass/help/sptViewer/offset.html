<center><H1>The optical pointing window</H1></center>

The optical pointing window is designed for manual optical
pointing. It provides an interactive way to adjust the current azimuth
and elevation offsets using the mouse, and a way to send a signal to
the active scheduling script to say that the star is centered.

<P>

The dialog presents a rectangular grid over which one clicks the left
mouse button to move the telescope. An arrow drawn between the center
of the grid and the mouse cursor shows the direction that the optical
camera image will move on the TV. Similarly, the distance away from
the center of the grid at which you click sets the distance to be
moved on the TV.  The effective size of the grid on the sky can be is
set by the contents of the &quot;<b>Grid Interval</b>&quot; entry
field below the grid. The number of arcseconds that you enter there,
is reflected in the separation of neighboring lines on the grid. The
same separation is used for the displayed concentric circles.  The
actual number of arcseconds that would be moved in the X and Y
directions of the TV, is displayed textually above the grid.

<P>

When the &quot;<b>Snap to grid</b>&quot; toggle button is depressed,
only offset positions that lie on the displayed grid vertices will be
allowed, and the cursor arrow will appear to jump from one to the next
as you move the cursor over the grid. The repeatability delivered by
this option can be useful if you want to move the telescope first one
way then back to its starting position.

<P>

The &quot;<b>Reverse arrow</b>&quot; toggle button reverses the
direction of the arrow that is drawn between the center of the grid
and the mouse cursor. This also reverses the direction that the
telescope moves when one clicks over a particular location of the
grid.

<P>

Pressing the button that says, &quot;<b>Press here when the star is
centered in the crosshairs</b>&quot; does two things. First it
executes a &quot;<a href=../mark.html>mark one, f0</a>&quot; command
to place a mark in the archive indicating that the star is centered.
Then after this has had time to propogate through to the control
system and get recorded along with the coordinates and centering
offsets of the current star, it executes a &quot;<a
href=../signal.html>signal done</a>&quot; command to tell the
currently executing schedule that it is safe to move to the next star.
The scheduling script can use the &quot;<a
href=../signaled.html>$signaled(done)</a>&quot; function to wait for
this signal. Without the delay between placing the mark in the archive
and moving on to the next star, the next star would erroneously get
marked as centered. During the delay, the star-centered button is
shown in red.

<H3>How to align of the grid</H3>

For the offset dialog to work properly the relative orientation of the
optical camera and the deck platform must be configured with the <a
href=../tv_angle.html>tv_angle</a> command. Once the appropriate angle
has been determined, this command should be placed in the <a
href=../control_config.html>sptControl.init</a> startup script.

<P>

If you don't know what this angle should be, then you can work it out
empirically by noticing what direction a star image on the TV monitor
moves when you click in a given direction over the grid.
