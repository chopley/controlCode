In the SPT there are a couple of groups of essentially identical
boards, each named with a common prefix followed by a number. Creating
individual, and otherwise identical, pages for each of these boards
would be a waste of time, and take up a lot of space on the screen.
Instead it is possible to create a single page which can be switched
between the different boards.

<P>
To create such a page, start by creating a normal page to display
registers from one of these boards, then pull down the
<b>Configure</b> menu of the page and select &quot;<b>Configure
Page</b>&quot;. This will bring up the page configuration dialog. At
the bottom of this dialog you will see a text entry field that is
annotated with the words &quot;Enable switching between numbered
boards who's names all start with&quot;.  In this field write the
initial part of the board name which is common to all of the boards in
the group, omitting the trailing number of the board, then hit the
<b>Apply</b> button. Provided that the viewer is currently connected
to the control program, or reading from the archive, you should then
see a row of numbered buttons appear just below the menu bar of the
page. These are the numeric suffixes that the viewer found in the
register map for the specified board prefix. Thereafter you can switch
between boards by pressing one of these buttons.

<P>

What actually happens when you press one of these buttons is that all
of the register display fields on the page are scanned for register
names that start with the specified board prefix, then the number that
follows this prefix is replaced with that on the button that you
pressed. The viewer then requests updates for this new selection of
registers from the control program (or the archive).
