The general characteristics of a page include its title, background
color, the size of the font used to display labels and register
display fields, the color of the warning borders to display around
out-of-range register fields, the default column width, and the
optional board name prefix to use with groups of equivalent boards.
All of these characteristics can be configured by pulling down the
page <b>Configure</b> menu, and selecting &quot;<b>Configure
Page</b>&quot;. This brings up the page configuration dialog, with the
following text entry fields:

<UL>
<LI> <b>Page Title</b>
<BR>The title that you provide here is shown both in the title bar of the
    page, and as the name of the icon of the page when it is in an
    iconized state.
<LI> <b>Page color</b>
<BR>This sets the background <a href=colors.html>color</a> of the
    page. This color is visible in empty cells, and is used as the
    default background color for new labels and register display
    fields.
<LI> <b><a name=font>Font size</a></b>
<BR>This sets the size of the font used in all of the labels and
    register display fields of the page.
<LI> <b><a name=warn>Warning color</a></b>
<BR>When a displayed register value is outside of a specified range,
    and <a href=register.html#warn>warnings are enabled</a> for the
    corresponding field, a border is drawn around the field with this
    <a href=colors.html>color</a>. If no color is specified, red is used.
<LI> <b><a name=colwidth>Default Column Width</a></b>
<BR>Whenever a new column is created, this value sets its initial
    width. The width is specified as a multiple of the width of an
    average character, and thus changes in physical size depending on
    which font has been chosen.
<LI> <b>Switch between numbered boards who's names all start with this
    prefix</b>
<BR>This allows a single page to multiplex between displaying the same
    registers of a number of equivalent boards. To disable this
    feature, leave the field blank. Type &quot;<a href=group.html>help
    page/group</a>&quot; for more details.
