To create a window for displaying live data values textually in a
rectangular grid, pull down the <b>Configure</b> menu of the main
window and select <code>Add Page</code>. This will create an empty
page with a menu bar. A page consists of a grid of rectangular cells,
arranged into columns and cells. Each cell can be set up to either
display the changing value of a specified register, or a fixed label.

Adding, modifying and deleting the contents of the individual cells of
a page grid is achieved by clicking the left mouse button over the
cell of interest.  This results in a menu being displayed under the
cursor. If there is currently no label or register display field under
the cursor, then a menu is displayed that gives you the choice of
creating either a fixed label or a register display field in that
cell. Selecting one of these results in the corresponding
configuration dialog being displayed.  Alternatively, if the cell is
already occupied, then the menu that is displayed lets you select
between modifying the contents of the cell, deleting its contents, or
saving the characteristics of the occupant to be used as the defaults
for the next label or register display field that you create.
