It is sometimes useful to be able to copy the text values of labels
and register display fields into another application. This can be done
using cut and paste. First select the fields whose contents you are
interested in. This involves holding the left mouse button down while
the mouse cursor is over the first field of interest, then while
continuing to hold down the mouse button, move the cursor over the
neighboring fields of interest. The selected fields will be
highlighted by having their background and foreground colors
temporarily swapped. When you let go of the mouse button, the text of
each of the selected fields will be available in the X-window cut
buffer, ready to be pasted into another application. The pasted text
includes spaces between the values of each of the selected fields.

<P>

To remove the highlight, simply select something else in another
window.
