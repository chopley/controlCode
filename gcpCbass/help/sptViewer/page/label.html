Creating a new label on a page is a matter of finding an unoccupied
cell on the page at the desired location, clicking the right mouse
over it to bring up the <b>Field Create</b> menu, and selecting
<b>Label</b>. Alternatively, if the target cell already contains a
label, then clicking the right mouse button over it will bring up a
menu that allows you to modify the label. If the cell contains a
register display field, then to place a label there you would first
have to either delete the register display field by clicking the right
mouse button over it and selecting the <b>Delete Field</b> option, or
you could <a href=drag.html>move</a> it to another cell with the
mouse.

<P>
<H2>The label configuration dialog</H2>

The configuration dialog that is displayed when you create or modify a
label, allows you to select the background <a
href=colors.html>color</a> of the field, the <a
href=colors.html>color</a> of the text of the label, where to place
the label within the field, and the text that you want to have
displayed in the field.

<P>
The position of the text within the field is specified via the
&quot;justify&quot; option menu button. Clicking on this button brings
up a menu of possible positions. The options are to center the text
within the field, left justify it, or right justify it.
