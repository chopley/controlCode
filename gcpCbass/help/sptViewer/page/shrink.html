When one creates a new page, it is common to manually increase the
size of the window to make room to add columns and rows. This
unfortunately turns off the automatic resizing that would otherwise
result in the page automatically adjusting its size to precisely
accomodate the area that is occupied by labels and register display
fields. As a result, after creating a new page, one is usually left
with unwanted margins around the new fields. To remedy this situation,
pull down the <b>Configure</b> menu of the page and select the
&quot;<b>Shrink wrap</b>&quot; option. This will adjust the page
dimensions to precisely enclose the occupied area of the page.
