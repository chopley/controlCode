The plot configuration dialog is displayed whenever one creates a
plot, and when one pulls down the <b>Configure</b> menu of a plot, and
selects <b>&quot;Modify Plot&quot;</b>. This dialog allows the title
of the plot to be specified, the x-axis to be configured, and the
specification of plotting attributes. The fields are as follows:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><b>Plot title</b>
<BR> Use this to set the title of the plot. This title is displayed
     within the plot itself, and is also used as the X-window title of
     the window both when visible and when iconized.
<LI><b>Register</b>
<BR> This is the register who's value is to be plotted along the
     X-axis. It should be a single element <a
     href=../regspec.html>register specification</a>.

<LI><b>Label</b>
<BR> This is the label to draw under the x-axis.
<LI><b>xmin</b>
<BR> This is the value to give the left end of the x-axis. This
     should be zero when scrolling is enabled.
<LI><b>xmax</b>
<BR> This is the value to give the right end of the x-axis.
     When scrolling is enabled, this specifies the length of
     the x-axis.
<LI><b>Scroll margin</b>
<BR> When the plot scrolls, a margin of this amount is left
     in the direction in which the data is moving along the
     x-axis. This ensures that the plot only has to scroll
     every so often. The margin is specified as a percentage
     of the width of the x-axis.
<LI><b>Scrolling mode</b>
<BR> This specifies whether and in which direction to scroll. The
     possible values are:

     <UL>
     <LI> <b>maximum</b>
     <BR> Scroll whenever data falls beyond the right edge of the
          plot.
     <LI> <b>minimum</b>
     <BR> Scroll whenever data falls beyond the left edge of the
          plot.
     <LI> <b>disabled</b>
     <BR> Don't scroll at all. The x-axis will have exactly the
          limits specified by <b>xmin</b> and <b>xmax</b>.
     </UL>
<LI><b>Marker size</b>
<BR> This specifies how wide the plotted dots and lines appear, in
     multiples of 0.005 inches. Note that the limited resolution of
     Sun displays means that one has to increase the width to 6 before
     any change is seen compared to a width of 1. This is not the case
     on modern printers, so the result is that a given width
     specification may look different when displaying on the screen
     than on a printer.
<LI><b>Draw lines between points</b>
<BR> With this button depressed, lines are drawn between points that
     were recorded sequentially in time by the antenna control system.
