To find out the statistics of the displayed portion of a given
register trace, start by switching to the statistics cursor-input
mode, either by pressing the &quot;<b>s</b>&quot; key within the plot
window, or by pulling down the <b>Cursor</b> menu of the plot window
and selecting <b>Stats</b>. The cursor will change to cross-hairs, and
thereafter, until the cursor input mode is changed, pressing the left
mouse button anywhere within the bounds of the plot will result in the
statistics of the trace associated with the nearest point to the
cursor being reported in a text area just below the plot.
