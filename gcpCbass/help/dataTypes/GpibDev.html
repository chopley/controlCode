<DT> Input Format:
<P>
<DD> An integer between 0 and 30 (inclusive).
<P>
<DT> Context:
<DD> Most expensive measuring instruments such as oscilloscopes and
     power meters can be controlled and monitored under computer
     control via a GPIB bus. Up to 30 devices can be daisy-chained on
     a GPIB bus, so to control any particular device one needs to know
     its GPIB address. This is a number between 0 and 30 that is
     usually set from the front panel of the instrument. Variables
     of type <code>GpibDev</code> are used to specify such addresses
     to the 
     <code><a href=../commands/gpib_read.html>gpib_read</a>()</code> and
     <code><a href=../commands/gpib_send.html>gpib_send</a>()</code>
     commands.
