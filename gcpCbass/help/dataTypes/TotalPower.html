<P>
The target output reading of a correlator total-power detector with
scale factor applied.

<DL>
<DT> Input Format:
<P>
<DD> A positive <a href=dt_class.html#float>floating point</a> number.

<P>
<DT> Operators:
<DD> <DL>
     <DT> <code>-a</code>
     <DD> The unary minus operator changes the sign of its operand.
     </DL>

<P>
<DT> Use with do-loops:
<DD> When a TotalPower variable is used as the dependent variable of a
     <a href="../commands/do.html">do-loop</a>, the associated loop increment is
     specified as a <a href="Double.html">Double</a> constant.

<P>
<DT> Examples:
<DD> The following example tells the channelizer to insert enough
     attenuation into the signal path of each channel to result in
     approximately 5.3 units being measured by the total power
     detectors of all correlator inputs.

<pre>
  tp all, all, 5.3
</pre>

<DT> Context:
<DD> The total power detectors in the SZA correlators are sampled by
     A/D converters that produce measurements of their input
     voltages. In order to set the total power inputs to the
     correlators one potentially has to insert different attenuations
     for each frequency band and each antenna. The amount of
     attenuation required depends upon the brightness of the input
     source, so different attenuations will be needed when observing
     planets than when observing the CMB. The <a href=../commands/tp.html>tp</a>
     command initiates an iterative process to find the attenuations
     that produce total powers as close as possible to the specified
     total power. The target total power is specified in user suplied
     units.
     The scale factor is convert raw ADC units into user power units
     is specified using the <code><a href=../commands/tpcal.html>tpcal</a></code>
     command.
     This target power is compared against the measured power at
     the end of each integration, after removing previously measured
     zero-offsets (see <code><a href=../commands/tpzero.html>tpzero</a></code>
     command).
